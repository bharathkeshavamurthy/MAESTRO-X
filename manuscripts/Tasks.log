1. Font is too small
2. A figure to show UAVs + HAPs + LEOs working together
3. Use a figure in Slide 4 instead of explaining the cases individually
4. Use only the TCCN journal paper
5. Move the deployment fig up to slide 10 with text on the side
6. Outer & Inner in slide 14 may be too much information: just say we leverage the multiscale structure of the problem
	Two layers: outer on endpoints
				inner on trajectories
	A figure would explain this better
7. Slide 11 explain SCA better
nonconvex -> iterative optimization -> convex approximations at a local point -> keep doing until convergence. Also, merge SCA channel model inaccuracy in point 1 so that itt's under one heading
8. Slide 15: We combines SMDP with a variant of CSO which allows us to capture realistic channel models, which you can't do with SCA
9. Slide 16: bring queue management into your talk on multi-UAV heuristics
10. Slide 19: Use a figure to explain the distance, angle, LoS, NLoS, probabilities, etc. Use a citation here.
11. Explain Slide 20 better. At the Tx, we know large-scale (beta, kappa, LoS/NLoS). Now, we try to adapt the rate to maximize tgpt.
12. Slide 21 and 22: Axes and Legends unreadable; specialize the figures for the ppt
13. Move the delay/throughput figure to slide 10 to show that service becomes bad at long distances from the BS
14. Moving is more efficient both in terms of power and link
15. State the problem and the Lagrangian and the dual via subgradient ascent
16. Figure (simplified block diagram) in Slide 24 
17. Angular symmetry allows us to have radius level as state, allows decomposition into multiscale structure, comm state action is also on radial position
18. A figure for the inner problems as well (HCSO): start with rough traj and then increase the resolution
19. Before I talk about MAESTRO-X, show the results for 1 UAV
20. Wait plots legend too small, yellow is not the right color
21. Figure in Slide 27, queues, spreads, and which UAV serves
22. Shadow Slide 28 to explain better
23. Explain conflict resolution in more detail: how is the queuing taken into account, energy-delay prediction tradeoff
show single-UAV case and multi-UAV case and diff
24. Slide 32: two cases 0.1 and >1
25. Split the decode and forward in Slide 33
Add GN, UAV and BS instead of dots; Remove legend details
26. Refs in Slide 34: move to next one before perf
27. Remove MAESTRO-Xalpha and MAESTRO-Xbeta
28. Slide 37 citations: SoA are adaptations of their papers | Adaptation of SCA/CIRCLE/CSCA
